# Subsystem 4 — test log

**Subsystem:** Monitor (example)  ·  **Student ID:** <student ID>  ·  **Code:** `app_program/subsystem4/`

See `testing/README.md` for how to run tests and record results.

## Test cases

Define a test here before running it. Test IDs never change.

| ID | What is tested | Requirement / interface | Method | Steps / how | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S4-U01 | message buffer max line = S4_SUMMARY_MAX | IF-03 | auto | `subsystem4_test.c` | `[TEST] S4-U01 PASS` |
| S4-U02 | LED pauses and resumes every 6 reports | IF-05 | manual | 1. Flash normal image. 2. Watch LED and console ~20 s. | console shows "LED task paused"/"resumed"; LED stops/starts |
| S4-U03 | Calibration, flat/tilt/ramp/hump sequences, odometry height validity, vibration, impact, and compass-rate estimate | Buddy 4 processing | host | Build and run `testing/buddy4/test_b4_algorithms.c` with the command in its header | All synthetic sequence checks pass; height remains invalid without odometry |
| S4-U04 | Compact event encoding, sample representation, and sensor raw conversion | Buddy 4 data representation | host | Build and run `testing/buddy4/test_b4_foundation.c` with the command in its header | All representation, conversion, and event encoding checks pass |

*Method:* **auto** = `TEST_CHECK` in code, result printed on the console;
**manual** = a person observes the result (LED, scope, meter, phone app…).

## Results

Add a new row for every run. Never edit or delete old rows.

| Date | Test ID | Commit | Tester | Result | Log / evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | S4-U01 | `abc1234` | | PASS / FAIL | `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_….txt` | |
